# Introduction

This directory contains a Notepad++ user defined language (.xml) for Scala programs - with dark theme.

More information about Notepad++ (Windows only) is available from:

   http://notepad-plus-plus.org/

# Installation

This UDL is an extension to the popular Dracula Notepad++ theme, for Scala.
If you don't have Dracula installed, please follow the instructions on https://github.com/dracula/notepad-plus-plus

Then, to install the UDL:
Copy the file "userDefineLang.xml" to the following location:

   %APPDATA%\Notepad++\

Restart your Notepad++ application.

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala" automatically
turns Scala mode on, with support for the Dracula color scheme.

Original Scala (clear themed) userDefineLang.xml was contributed by Stephane Micheloud (stephane.micheloud@epfl.ch)
See https://github.com/scala/scala-tool-support/tree/master/tool-support/notepad-plus

This UDL is based on Dracula configs for Java. Do not hesitate to contribute for improvments!
